# Thesis

"The balance of nature is not a status quo; it is fluid, ever shifting, in a constant state of adjustment." - Rachel Carson

The original idea for this project was to show the precariousness of the interactions between animals, and to highlight how difficult it can be to maintain balance within an ecosystem. There are five different animal types, with interactions between them to simulate their eating habits and their life cycles. At the start of the simulation the user can decide how many of each group they would like to place, and then place them on the map. After these initial placements the user can no longer control the movement of the animals, and instead will watch the simulation play out, observing the interactions and learning from them, which will allow them to make different choices the next time they run it.

This project was built with Unity 2021.3.9f1 and this repository includes both a MacOS and Windows build.
